# Workspace of the Brussels Half Marathon of 2017

This is a [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)/[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) of my thought process in analysing the results of the Brussels Half last year (2017)


## Datasets
The original dataset comes from the official results website. On which I scrapped the data using BeautifulSoup and dumped the only relevant output to
the results.html file. This file is stored locally and then converted to a Pandas Dataframe.
